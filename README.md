### About The Project

Grades Web App

For this project, I developed the front-end and back-end of a web application allowing a user (specifically an instructor) to modify student data entries. I implemented a REST API with Flask to allow a user to view, edit, add, and delete a studentâ€™s grades from a SQL database.
Additionally, I used SQLAlchemy to design a database that interfaced with the REST API.
